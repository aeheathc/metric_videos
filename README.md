# Metric Videos
actix-web + React app showing a dashboard of real-time video streaming metrics

## How to run
- Run `cargo run` in the project root with Rust installed.
- You can also build it and run the executable in any location. Use the `--help` option to see how to tell it where to find the "data" directory, so it can load the static resources, config file, etc.

## Other things you can do with the code
- Run `cargo test` to run the unit tests
- Run `cargo clippy` to run the linter
- Run `cargo doc` to build HTML docs from the "doc comments" found in the source. The docs will be available at `target/doc/metric_videos/index.html`
